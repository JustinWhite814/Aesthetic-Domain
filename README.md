Welcome to Aesthetic Domain! I created a virtual art museum called Aesthetic Domain! This app had quite a bit of moving parts! 


## MVP
* Connect our application to the API
* Load artwork into a gallery when our application loads
* Display 20 artwork cards in the gallery at a time, and paginate through all artworks pulled from the API
* When an artwork card is clicked on, display a details page that shows more information about the piece of art
* Sign up/login capabilities
* Allow guest users (users that are not logged in) to browse the museum, and view comments, but restrict them from creating comments or reacting to artwok
* Logged in users will be able to browse the museum, react to artwork, and add comments. Additionally, they will be able to edit or delete their own comments
* Style the site with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
